# DIALOGUE RULES — THRILLER EDITION

1. Keep lines short in danger scenes.
2. Use subtext — characters rarely say what they mean.
3. Silence is a dialogue tool.
4. Interruptions increase tension.
5. Avoid long emotional speeches.
6. Evan speaks calmly, simply, with unsettling precision.
7. Emma's dialogue = reactive, breathless, anxious.
8. Liam = emotional, urgent, sometimes messy.
9. Jenna = bright but trembling.
10. Use physical beats between lines to show fear or conflict.
