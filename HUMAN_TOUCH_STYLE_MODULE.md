# HUMAN TOUCH STYLE MODULE

Rules for natural, human-sounding prose:

1. Vary sentence lengths (short in tension, longer in reflection).
2. Use emotional microbeats (breath, weight shift, glance).
3. Avoid “perfect grammar” when it kills realism.
4. Allow interrupted thoughts.
5. Use sensory detail sparingly but meaningfully.
6. Internal monologue must be specific, not generic.
7. Characters should reveal emotion through behavior, not explanation.
8. Avoid over-clarification.
9. Keep subtle messiness — humans are not perfect narrators.
10. Preserve the “wounded intelligence” of Emma’s voice.

Output must feel:
- lived-in  
- intimate  
- real  
- emotionally raw  
- human, not AI-generated.
