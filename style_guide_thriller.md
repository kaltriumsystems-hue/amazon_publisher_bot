# THRILLER STYLE GUIDE — AMAZON PRO EDITION

## POV & Voice
- Always keep a tight **1st-person limited** internal world.
- Emma’s voice = anxious, observant, hyperaware, wounded but resilient.
- Avoid purple prose. Keep emotional beats sharp.
- Keep internal thoughts fragmented during fear.

## Pacing
- Paragraphs short for tension.
- Moments of introspection no longer than 2–3 sentences.
- Action = clipped, visceral, sensory-light but impactful.

## Dialogue
- Subtext > exposition.
- Use silence, half-sentences, controlled tone.
- Avoid explaining emotions; imply them.

## Atmosphere
- Winter = danger, silence, exposure.
- Storm = isolation, unpredictability.
- Lodge = claustrophobic, old, too warm, watching.

## Hooks
- Every chapter ends with:
  - a shocking detail  
  - a twist  
  - a threat  
  - a revelation  
  - or a line that shifts the character’s understanding

## Emotion
- Show fear through:
  - breath  
  - sound  
  - cold  
  - sensation  
  - instinct  
- Avoid melodramatic metaphors.

## Language
- Crisp verbs.  
- No filler verbs (“started to,” “seemed to,” “began to”).  
- Remove vague words (“a little,” “somehow,” “kind of”).

## Consistency Protection
- Evan = calm, patient, precise.
- Liam = guilt-driven, reactive, emotional.
- Jenna = masking fear with brightness.
- Michael = strained, vigilant.

## Final Rule
Everything must feel like a **premium Kindle thriller**.
